# IoTWorkshop

This is a series of three hands on workshops I created for the general public. I have run these in Brighton over 6 weeks. Each one takes roughly 2 hours except the first one which can take a bit longer.

The attendee is given an ESP8266 device, a strip of LEDs and a jumper cables for the duration of the course.
